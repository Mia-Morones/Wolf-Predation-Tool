# Wolf Predation App

## Getting Started
Before you start, make sure you have a fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed. The current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point.

1. Fork this repository and clone your own fork to your computer: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-redux-boilerplate.git
    ```


2. From the project's root directory, install the required packages (dependencies):

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. To run and test the app on your local machine (http://localhost:8080):

    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

    This will start a server instance and begin listening for connections from localhost on port `8080`.

4. To build/deploye the app, you can run:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

    This will place all files needed for deployment into the `/docs` directory.
